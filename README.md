# GeoPong

GeoPong is a multiplayer implementation of [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).

This is a demo project to experiment with Elixir and [OTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform#:~:text=OTP%20is%20a%20collection%20of,Erlang%2FOTP%20as%20open%20source). The architecture of the project is based on findings from the amazing book [Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action) and supplementary articles such as [OTP as the Core of Your Application Part 2](https://akoutmos.com/post/actor-model-genserver-app-two/).

## How to Play

1. Create a new game
2. On two separate devices (or browser windows) join the game
3. Play Pong
